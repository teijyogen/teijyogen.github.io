I am an Assistant Professor with tenure at the [Onizuka Lab](http://www-bigdata.ist.osaka-u.ac.jp/en/home/), Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, Osaka University.
I received my Ph.D. in Informatics from Kyoto University in 2023, under the supervision of Prof. [Masatoshi Yoshikawa](https://scholar.google.co.jp/citations?user=yMFHG7wAAAAJ&hl=ja) and Prof. [Yang Cao](https://yangcao888.github.io/).
Currently, I am working with Prof. [Makoto Onizuka](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oJ6G8gUAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Chuan Xiao](https://sites.google.com/site/chuanxiao1983/).
My research interests lie at the intersection of computer science, law, and economics, with a particular focus on data market, data privacy, and computational law.
Please contact me if you are interested in any form of collaboration.
